# Vocabulary Interaction Prototype

### Overview

A design prototype that rethinks vocabulary learning as an interactive process, not just memorization. It introduces two learning modes — **passive** (recognition) and **active** (production) — to better match how users encounter and use new words.

### Interaction Model

**Encounter → Commit → Review → Re-encounter**

- **Encounter:** The user looks up a word.
- **Commit:** The meaning is saved as passive or active vocabulary.
- **Review:** Mode-specific practice supports either recognition or production.
- **Re-encounter:** Words resurface over time for long-term retention.

### Features

- Grouped word meanings with contextual examples
- Passive and active review modes
- Lightweight browser-based prototype
- Built with **React**, **TypeScript**, and **Mantine**
- Follows HCI principles for accessibility and low-friction interaction

### Focus

The prototype explores interaction design for language learning reducing cognitive load, promoting contextual understanding, and enabling purposeful review rather than rote memorization.
